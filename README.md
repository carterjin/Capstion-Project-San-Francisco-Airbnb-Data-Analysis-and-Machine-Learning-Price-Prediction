### Motivations

The object of this project is to help airbnb company and the hosts in San Francisco better understand location and price patterns and also suggest a pricing based on their housings. Some of the questions that I have analyzed are:

- What are the locations that people rent airbnb?
- How does neighborhood affect pricing?
- Do superhosts provide a better renting experience?
- Can we provide a prediction on pricing given the information we are provided?
